# Pairwise-Ranking-of-Premier-League-Teams

This is my final year honors research project. It is based on learning to rank teams in the premier league.

There are five different files each file representing a different model or technique used to rank the premier league. 
The procedure is as follows, each file contains 5 training python files and 5 test python files. All 5 python files 
need to be trained first and then the test files to make the actual predictions. Thereafter, there is a jupyter notebook
file that contains the evaluation of each test season and it gives a mean average precision score and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain.
